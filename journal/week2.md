## Sinatra 
[Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/documentation.html) is a free and open source micro server framework written in Ruby.

We have been provided with the code for this server. It will act as a mock server.

We cloned the code from into this repository along with the Bash scripts for [Create Read Update Delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (CRUD)

## Gitpod environment
We updated the gitpod.yml file to automatically start the server when a Gitpod workspace is launched.
